<!-- Turntable -->

## Turntable, the mighty one
Did you ever wanted to catalog your vinyl colection in an geeky and strange way? If this resumes you, then look no furter, this Java application can store and organize all your vinyl collection, including your personal rating, the year of the album, artist, a photo of the cover art, the RPM, the color of the vinyl and much more.

### How it works?
It's fairly simple, the application is self contained and have all the dependencies needed to run, and the best part is that Turntable is fully multiplatform. You just need to run the .jar and that is it.
